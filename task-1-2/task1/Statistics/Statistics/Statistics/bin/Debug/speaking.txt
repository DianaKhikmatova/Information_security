If I asked you to picture the air, what do you imagine?
Most people think about either empty spaceor clear blue 
sky or sometimes trees dancing in the wind. And then I 
remember my high school chemistry teacher with really 
long socks at the blackboard, drawing diagrams of bubbles
connected to other bubbles, and describing how they 
vibrate and collide in a kind of frantic soup.
But really, we tend not to think about the air that much 
at all. We notice it mostly when there's some kind of 
unpleasant sensory intrusion upon it, like a terrible 
smell or something visible like smoke or mist.
