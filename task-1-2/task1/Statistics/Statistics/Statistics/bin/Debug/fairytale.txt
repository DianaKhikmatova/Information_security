There was once a king who had three sons, all remarkably handsome 
in their persons, and in their tempers brave and noble. Some wicked 
courtiers made the king believe that the princes were impatient to 
wear the crown, and that they were contriving a plot to deprive him 
of his sceptre and his kingdom. The king felt he was growing old; 
but as he found himself as capable of governing as he had ever been, 
he had no inclination to resign his power; and therefore, that he 
might pass the rest of his days peaceably, he determined to employ 
the princes in such a manner, as at once to give each of them the 
hope of succeeding to the crown, and fill up the time they might 
otherwise spend in so undutiful a manner.
